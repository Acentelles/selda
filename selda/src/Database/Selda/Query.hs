-- | Execute a query, returning an aggregation of its results.
--   The query must return an inductive tuple of 'Aggregate' columns.
--   When @aggregate@ returns, those columns are converted into non-aggregate
--   columns, which may then be used to further restrict the query.
--
--   Note that aggregate queries must not depend on outer queries, nor must
--   they return any non-aggregate columns. Attempting to do either results in
--   a type error.
--
--   The SQL @HAVING@ keyword can be implemented by combining @aggregate@
--   and 'restrict':
--
-- > -- Find the number of people living on every address, for all addresses
-- > -- with more than one tenant:
-- > -- SELECT COUNT(name) AS c, address FROM housing GROUP BY name HAVING c > 1
-- >
-- > numPpl = do
-- >   num_tenants :*: address <- aggregate $ do
-- >     _ :*: address <- select housing
-- >     groupBy address
-- >     return (count address :*: some address)
-- >  restrict (num_tenants .> 1)

-- | Perform a @LEFT JOIN@ with the current result set (i.e. the outer query)

--   for each row whether to join or not. This predicate may depend on any
--   values from the outer query.

--   together with their address if they have one; if they don't, the address
--   field will be @NULL@.
